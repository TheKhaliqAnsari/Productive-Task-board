# Vercel Deployment Fix for Login Issues

## Problem
Users can register but cannot login on Vercel deployment, getting "Invalid credentials" error even with correct username/password.

## Root Causes
1. **File System Limitations**: Vercel serverless functions have read-only file systems, so database writes might not persist between requests
2. **JWT Secret**: Hardcoded JWT secret needs to be consistent across deployments
3. **Environment Variables**: Missing environment variables for production

## Solutions

### 1. Set Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard

Go to your Vercel project dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables and add:

```
JWT_SECRET = your-secure-random-jwt-secret-key
```

**Important**: Use a strong, random secret (e.g., generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)

### 2. Database Persistence Issue

The current implementation uses file-based storage which doesn't persist in Vercel's serverless environment. For production, you have these options:

#### Option A: Use Vercel KV (Recommended for Production)
1. Enable Vercel KV in your project
2. Update the database layer to use KV storage instead of file system

#### Option B: Use External Database
1. Use services like MongoDB Atlas, PlanetScale, or Supabase
2. Update the database layer to connect to external database

#### Option C: Accept Temporary Storage (Demo Only)
- Current implementation will work for single-session demos
- Data will reset on each deployment/cold start
- Users need to re-register after cold starts

### 3. Immediate Fix Steps

1. **Set JWT_SECRET environment variable** in Vercel dashboard
2. **Redeploy** the application
3. **Clear browser cookies** for the site
4. **Register a new account** on the deployed version
5. **Try logging in** with the new account

### 4. Check Logs

To debug login issues:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard → Functions tab
2. Click on a recent API request
3. Check the console logs for detailed error messages

## Updated Code Changes

The following improvements have been made:

1. **JWT Secret**: Now uses environment variable with fallback
2. **Error Logging**: Added detailed console logs for debugging
3. **Database Operations**: Added error handling for file system operations
4. **Cookie Settings**: Improved security settings for production

## Testing

After deployment:
1. Open browser developer tools → Network tab
2. Try logging in and check the API response
3. Look for console logs in Vercel dashboard
4. If still failing, try registering a completely new account

## Support

If login still fails after these steps:
1. Check Vercel function logs for specific error messages
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Try using incognito mode to avoid cookie conflicts
4. Consider migrating to a proper database solution for production use
